        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Flag Frenzy mobile application and related services ("Flag Frenzy", "the App", "we", "us", or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> These Terms are provided for general information and do not constitute legal advice. Your statutory rights are not limited where the law does not allow it.</p>
        </div>

        <p>For our Privacy Policy, see the in-app Legal section or contact us at <a href="mailto:jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com">jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>1) Who We Are and Contact</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>2) Eligibility and Account</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use the App. If you are under the age of majority, you may use the App only with the consent of a parent/guardian.</li>
            <li>We may allow optional sign-in (e.g., via Google Play Games). You are responsible for keeping your device/account secure and for all activity under your account or device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) License and Ownership</h2>
        <p><strong>License:</strong> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial entertainment purposes.</p>

        <p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the App; circumvent security; use cheats/bots; or use the App for any unlawful purpose.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The App may include virtual items, buffs/debuffs, power-ups, and in-game currency (collectively, "Virtual Items"). Virtual Items have no real-world monetary value, do not constitute property, and are licensed to you, not sold.</li>
            <li>Virtual Items may be earned through gameplay, ads, or purchased. We may manage, regulate, control, modify, or remove Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice, and have no liability to you for such actions to the maximum extent permitted by law.</li>

            <li>We do not guarantee ad availability or rewards. Ads may be personalized or contextual depending on your settings and consent where required. See our Privacy Policy for details on how ads and analytics work.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Online features (e.g., multiplayer rooms, leaderboards, events) may be added, removed, or modified at any time.</li>
            <li>You agree not to engage in cheating, exploiting bugs, account sharing, harassment, hate speech, or any behavior that undermines fair play or other players' experience.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>8) User Content</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We collect and process information as described in our Privacy Policy (see in-app Legal section). This may include device and usage data, analytics, advertising identifiers, gameplay stats, and account data if you sign in.</li>
            <li>We may retain data as necessary for providing and improving the App, security, and legal compliance. We cannot guarantee deletion in all cases; see our Privacy Policy for details.</li>
            <li>International transfers may occur. By using the App, you consent to processing as described in the Privacy Policy.</li>

            <li>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access (including accounts) if you violate these Terms or if we discontinue the App, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</li>
            <li>Upon termination, your license ends and you must cease use. We may delete, disable, or otherwise manage accounts and Virtual Items without liability, except where prohibited by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12) Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App and all content are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that defects will be corrected, or that results will meet your requirements.</p>

        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; loss of profits, data, goodwill; service interruption; device damage; or costs of substitute services arising out of or in connection with the App or these Terms, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The App may integrate third-party SDKs and services (e.g., ads, analytics, authentication, cloud hosting). Their processing and terms are governed by their own policies; we are not responsible for their acts or omissions.</li>
            <li>Links to third-party sites or content are provided for convenience and do not imply endorsement.</li>
