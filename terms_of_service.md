To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; loss of profits, data, goodwill; service interruption; device damage; or costs of substitute services arising out of or in connection with the App or these Terms, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
