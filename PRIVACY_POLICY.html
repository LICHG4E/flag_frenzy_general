        <h1>Privacy Policy for Flag Frenzy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 5, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Flag Frenzy mobile application ("Flag Frenzy", "the App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information when you use the App.</p>

        <p>By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This Policy is provided for general information and does not constitute legal advice. Nothing here seeks to limit your statutory rights or our obligations under applicable law.</p>

        <h2>1) Who We Are and Scope</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operator:</strong> The developer of Flag Frenzy based in Tunisia.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com">jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com</a></li>
            <li>This Policy applies to the App, related services, and any in-app events or features. It does not apply to third-party websites, services, or apps that we do not control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following categories of information:</p>

        <p><strong>a) Personal Information (if you choose to provide or enable it)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account data: email address, display name, profile image if you sign in with providers (e.g., Google).</li>
            <li>Player identifiers: a user ID we assign or an ID provided by platform services (e.g., Google Play Games).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>b) Gameplay and App Data</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Game progress: scores, achievements, progression, session stats, difficulty, and mode selections.</li>
            <li>In-app purchases and inventory: purchased items, currencies, and consumables.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>c) Device and Usage Data (often collected automatically)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device info: device model, OS version, language, time zone, app version.</li>
            <li>Usage and diagnostics: feature usage, session length, events, performance metrics, crash logs.</li>
            <li>Approximate location: derived from IP or device settings by our service providers (e.g., for fraud prevention, analytics, ad compliance).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>d) Advertising and Analytics</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ad identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID) and engagement metrics to support ads and measure their performance.</li>
            <li>Analytics events to improve features and stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>e) Sources</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Directly from you (when you play, sign in, or contact us).</li>
            <li>Automatically via the App and SDKs.</li>
            <li>From service providers (e.g., authentication, analytics, ads, cloud storage, leaderboard services).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We process information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and operate the App, including authentication, gameplay, and cloud sync (if enabled).</li>
            <li>Personalize and improve the user experience, content, and difficulty.</li>
            <li>Show ads (including contextual or personalized ads where permitted/consented).</li>
            <li>Process purchases, rewards, and in-app economy.</li>
            <li>Monitor and enhance performance, security, and fraud prevention.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you about updates, changes, or support.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms and policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Where applicable (e.g., EU/EEA), our legal bases include: performance of a contract (providing the App), legitimate interests (analytics, security, improvements), consent (personalized ads, certain analytics), and legal obligations.</p>

        <h2>4) Advertising, Analytics, and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We work with third-party partners that may process data under their own policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising networks (e.g., Google Mobile Ads/AdMob) for ad delivery, frequency capping, and measurement.</li>
            <li>Analytics and diagnostics (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics or similar).</li>
            <li>Authentication and platform/game services (e.g., Google Play Services, leaderboards, achievements).</li>
            <li>Cloud hosting and realtime services (e.g., Supabase or similar) if cloud sync/multiplayer features are enabled.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These partners may collect device identifiers, ad identifiers, usage data, and approximate location. Their processing is governed by their own privacy policies. You can manage ad personalization via device settings where available.</p>

        <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>

        <h2>5) How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>We may share information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With service providers who process data for us (ads, analytics, hosting, authentication, payments) under appropriate safeguards.</li>
            <li>For legal reasons: to comply with laws or binding requests (court orders, subpoenas), to protect rights, safety, and security, or to prevent fraud/abuse.</li>
            <li>Business transfers: in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to applicable law.</li>
            <li>With your direction or consent (e.g., platform sharing to leaderboards).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the App, for legitimate business purposes (e.g., security, fraud prevention, backups), and to comply with legal obligations. We may retain aggregated or de-identified data for analytics and reporting.</p>

        <p><strong>Deletion requests:</strong> We will honor requests where required by applicable law. Otherwise, deletion may not be available in all cases. Deletion from active systems may take time, and copies may persist in backups or logs for a period. Data collected and stored by third parties (e.g., ad networks) is subject to their policies.</p>

        <h2>7) Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You use the App at your own risk, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>8) Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent where required by law (e.g., COPPA). If you are a parent/guardian and believe your child provided personal information without consent, contact us at <a href="mailto:jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com">jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com</a>. We will take appropriate steps as required by applicable law. Ad experiences for children may be limited to contextual ads where required.</p>

        <h2>9) International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>We may process and store information in countries other than your own (including outside Tunisia). Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.</p>

        <h2>10) Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, object to, restrict, or request deletion of certain information, and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requests:</strong> Contact <a href="mailto:jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com">jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com</a>. We may request verification and may deny or limit requests as permitted by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalized ads:</strong> You can limit or reset ad identifiers and disable ad personalization in your device settings. Some features may be affected.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud sync:</strong> You can opt out of cloud sync in App settings (if offered).</li>
            <li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> We currently do not respond to DNT signals.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Where local laws (e.g., GDPR/UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA) apply, we will comply with those laws' requirements.</p>

        <h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice in-app or by other reasonable means. Continued use of the App after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>

        <h2>12) Contact Us</h2>
        <div class="contact">
            <p>For questions, complaints, or requests related to privacy:</p>
            <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com">jhmobileapps.dev@gmail.com</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2>13) Governing Law</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the Republic of Tunisia, without regard to conflict of laws rules. Where the laws of another jurisdiction apply to you (e.g., GDPR in the EU/EEA or CCPA/CPRA in California), we will comply with those legal requirements in addition to Tunisian law, as applicable.</p>

        <h2>14) Additional Notices for Specific Jurisdictions (If Applicable)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>EU/EEA/UK:</strong> You may have rights under GDPR/UK GDPR. Our legal bases are described in Section 3. You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</li>
            <li><strong>California:</strong> We do not "sell" personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. You may have rights to know, delete, and correct certain information, subject to exceptions.</li>
        </ul>
